# Instructions

If you have a dictionary with 3 student names and their test scores, can you print the highest score?

e.g. if
```
studentsAndscores = ["Amy": 88, "James": 55, "Helen": 99]
```
Then your function should print 99.

But you don't know what the scores are, so your program has to handle all possibilities!

Hint: When you get the value out of a dictionary using a key, the value that comes out is an Optional!

Be sure to test your code using sample inputs and try out your code in the main.swift file.
