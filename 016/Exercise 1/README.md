## If/Else Exercise

# Instructions

Every 4 years, there is a leap year. Leap years have an extra day in February to bring the total number of days up to 366 instead of 365.

The 3 conditions for any given year to be a leap year are:

* The year is exactly divisible by four (with no reminder) then it is a leap year, unless:

* If the year is also divisible by 100 (years ending in two zeros), then it is not a leap year, except if

* It is also divisible by 400 (in this case it will be a leap year).

Complete the `isLeap()` function to print "YES" if the input is a leap year and "NO" if the input year was not.

### Double Checking Leap Years

You can check Wikipedia for the conditions expressed in your native language.

For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is. If in doubt [you can check if a year is a leap year here](http://time-and-calendar.com/leap-years).


## Note 

Make sure you don't change line 2 in main.swift and you don't need to call the `isLeap()` function below, otherwise the tests may not run correctly. Remember, the only part of Exercise.swift you should change is inside the `isLeap()` function.
