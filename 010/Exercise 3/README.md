## Randomisation Exercise

# Instructions
You are going to create a password generator. We have created an array called `alphabet` which contains all 26 letters in the alphabet.

Write some code to randomly pick 6 letters out of the alphabet to create a random 6 character password.

You can test out your code in the main.swift file.



# Hint

You can add characters together with the `+` symbol. e.g.

```
var a = "Simone"
var b = "Margio"
var c = a + b
print(c) //The output would be: "SimoneMargio"
```

NOTE: The variable `password` should be a String of characters like "vacbae" or "abcefg", it should not be an array.
