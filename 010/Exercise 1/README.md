## Variables Exercise

# Instructions

Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables `a` and `b` inside the main.swift file. 

**Warning.** Do not change the code on lines 1-4 and 16-20. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any value of a and b.

# Example Input 1

```
a: 5
```

```
b: 8
```

# Example Output 1

```
a: 8
```

```
b: 5
```

Your code should also work for any value. For example if `a` has the value "Hello" and `b` is "Jack" then:


# Example Input 2

```
a: "Hello"
```

```
b: "Jack"
```

# Example Output 2

```
a: "Jack"
```

```
b: "Hello"
```

# Hint

1. You should not have to type any numbers in your code. 
2. You might need to make some more variables.
